If you, specifically want to redirect, above answers are helpful. But if you are doing this because base is "HTTP", then,
redirecting is not correct method (as it asks for resources).
Instead, open "application/config/config.php" in your project and change the value of

$config['base_url']

Add "s" in the value

from

$config['base_url'] = 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

How to redirect http to https in codeigniter

to

$config['base_url'] = 'https://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];


[3 Step]

First go to the application/config/config.php file and look for this line:

$config['base_url'] = "";

Set it to your URL with the https e.g. https://example.com

$config['base_url'] = "https://example.com";

Then go to your [.htaccess] file and add this line in the example given below.

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://example.com/$1 [R,L]

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    
    #Options +FollowSymLinks
    #Options -Indexes
    RewriteEngine on

    # Send request via index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://example.com/$1 [R,L]
    
</IfModule>
