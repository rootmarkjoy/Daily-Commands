What is Phishing? 
Phishing attacks use 'spoofed' e-mails and fraudulent websites designed to fool recipients into divulging personal financial data such as credit card numbers, account usernames and passwords, social security numbers, etc. 
By hijacking the trusted brands of well-known banks, online retailers and credit card companies, phishers are able to convince up to 5% of recipients to respond to them.

Phishing reply:-
Thank you for updating us,
We have disabled given phishing URL from the server and scanned whole account along with changing password for problem account.
Please check the same & confirm.

I apologize for the inconveniences caused.

Yes, we were aware of the issue and we have taken required steps to optimize the services on our server. Kindly check and monitor the website performance and confirm.


I am just looking into this for you now, your patience is greatly appreciated at this time. 
I will update you via this ticket once I have more information.

===================================================================

As per chat conversation, we have opened a ticket for you regarding website down. 
Once we have more information will let you know on the same ticket.


You don't have to worry about that, license are auto renewed from our dashboard. We will take care of it.
===================================================================

Hello,
Thank you for the email.
We have checked and see that our mail server IP is blacklisted due to that mails are receiving in the spam box. However, we have already placed an IP delist request. it will take 24 to 48 hrs for delisting of IP once it gets delisted your emais should work. It depends on the provider when they delist the IP
Once the IP gets delisted, the emails should start working fine. 

go to >> cpanel >> SOFTWARE >> MultiPHP INI Editor >> select domain from drop down list >> edit the memory_limit 128M >> Save it

===================================================================

Thank you for your patience.
As our server, IP is not blacklisted anywhere and IP reputation of the server IP is good as well. 
We have already placed the IP review request to email service provider. 
We will have to wait till they start accepting the emails in Inbox. 
Unfortunately, we do not guarantee the email delivery in Inbox as every email service provider has their own policies and filters.



====================================================================
I have checked the IP 103.108.220.2 and can see it is not blacklisted and its IP reputation is neutral. You can check the below link for confirmation.

https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=blacklist%3a103.108.220.2&run=toolpage
https://www.talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/lookup?search=103.108.220.2

It seems that outlook is blocking emails from the IP and I have placed a delist request and once the IP gets delisted your emails will work.

===================================================================

Optimize site:-
---------------
Thank you for for your patience.
We have checked your website polytechadda.com and it is consuming high resources. Page size of this website is around 3MB and it require lots of optimization. When website gets accessed 290 requests gets sent and due to that it is consuming high resources. On reseller hosting we provide 1CPU and 1GB RAM for each cPanel account. We tried to increase the resources to 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs but still website is consuming all the resources. So basically your website require more resources to work properly.
Also we have checked the website on gtmetrix. You can check below URL
https://gtmetrix.com/reports/polytechadda.com/8l4jAVHE
If you go to Yslow tab. Lots of optimization required. You can also consider using CDN like Cloudflare for your website.
Or you can purchase separate shared hosting plan for this website like Value or Unlimited plan in which we provide more resources.

----------------------------------------------

I have reset the settings on the server for your account. I can see the improvement in the loading speed now. Refer https://gtmetrix.com/reports/polytechadda.com/gu5p4rzf once.
However, this is a temporary solution. You must optimize and make the changes mentioned by Manish.
Refund is applicable on first 30 days and not later.

Mail function() disable:-
-------------------------
I need to inform you that, We have experienced a lot of spam and other unsolicited mail being sent from the shared and reseller servers.
This has affected number of clients hosted on these servers.
For the benefit of majority of our customers, the management has decided to disable PHP mail function on these servers
PHP mail() function is disabled on all our shared and reseller servers.
If you wish to send email from your website or contact forms,
you will have to use SMTP authentication.



We have experienced a lot of spam and other unsolicited mail being sent from the shared and reseller servers. This has affected number of clients hosted on these servers so due to that we have disabled the mail function on the server.
We suggest you to use SMTP mail function.
We have posted a more in-depth article in our knowledgebase on sending e-mails using SMTP authentication.
https://www.milesweb.com/hosting-faqs/send-email-php-script-using-smtp-authentication/
https://www.milesweb.com/hosting-faqs/using-smtp-authentication-send-email-wordpress/
https://www.milesweb.com/hosting-faqs/set-outgoing-smtp-email-magento/
We do not offer support on scripting related issues as it falls out of the scope of web hosting technical support. But still we will try our best to help you with fixing the PHP mail related issues.

===================================================================

Please follow below steps to install SSL

Cpanel >> SECURITY >> Let's Encrypt™ SSL >> Issue

To set the redirection from http to https use below code under .htaccess file

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

===================================================================

Just to follow up on this, we didnt received any reply on this from your side yet.

Can you please confirm.

===================================================================

We are still awaiting for your reply. Do you wish to carry on with this service? If so you will need to first re-register the domain which you can do via your control panel.

===================================================================

Email replay:-
--------------
Thanks for waiting. I'm just checking with our system admin team to ensure we get the process right before proceeding to ensure as little disruption as possible to your emails.
When I have hear back from them I will let you know so you can retrieve any further emails before we proceed with the change.
Please stand by.


Our hosting plans are crafted to host websites with optimum performance and not for storage. 
The web space cannot be used to store or maintain backups. If you want to take backup of your website you can use FTP for files & contents. 
Or for the database, backup you can export the database it will download at your local machine.

========================================================

Email send by third party:-
---------------------------

I can assure you no details are passed on to third parties by other than to our registrar for the purpose of securing and renewing a domain.

There are many ways to obtain company contact details online. I'm afraid in this day and age unsolicited marketing is more and more prominent.

That said, checking your account I can see you registered the domain on the 7th Oct, but the privacy was not ordered until the 15th, so your details would have been available for 8 days. Plenty of time for your details to be grabbed. Many marketing companies will use software to automatically monitor new domain registrations and grab domain admin details in order to send out marketing emails.

Once that has happened there really isn't much you can do apart from wait until they die down and configuring your junk mail filters.

I hope that explains. If you have any questions please do let us know.

Website hacked reply:-
----------------------
Im afraid finding out where there is a security loop hole in your website code is beyond our support remit. Its not a service we provide Im afraid.

You should ask your web developer to review your websites code.

If you are running Wordpress, you should ensure all plugins etc are up to date.

We can restore a backup of your website for you (prior to is being hacked) but yes as you say it may well get hacked again. But we are not able to re-instate the hosting space in its current (hacked) state as it poses a security risk. If you have your own backup you can use that.

Protocol in these situations is as follows:

Before we can re-enable the hosting plan all files within public_html must be removed/deleted from our servers.
FTP passwords must be updated.
Either you can upload your own backup of the website or we can restore one for you.

We can assist you with clearing out the existing files, restoring a backup and changing passwords etc. but you will need to review the website code to establish how/where the site was hacked.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

How do I transfer my .uk domain name away to a new host?
Transferring your .uk domain to a new host is very easy. You simply need to change the Nominet IPSTAG for your domain to the one provided by your new host.

    Log into your Customer Area
    Click ‘Manage Domain Names’
    Click the link under ‘List Your Domains’
    Click the ‘Manage’ link for the domain you wish to edit

    Enter in the new tag
    Click ‘Change Nominet Tag’
    Your IPSTAG will be changed
    Nominet will update your domain and transfer the domain in
Reply: You will just need to change to our TAG [Tag = EXTEND] at your domain registrar end, and then order transfer via your control panel.

===================================================================

From looking into this further this does appear to be related to the on-going issues with sending to Outlook, as they were rate-limiting a part of our servers. However, we have received word from them, that they will allow the emails to go to their customers unrestricted as long as the sender has a valid SPF record attached. For most customers this appears to be working and solving the issue. To add the SPF record you can do this by going into your DNS settings for the domain and doing the following:
1) Go into the Heart Internet Customer Area.
2) Then click "Manage Domain Names".
3) Find the domain you wish to update the details for in the drop-down menu, then click "Manage Now".
4) Then click on the "DNS Management" button.
5) Scroll down to the "TXT Records" section, leave the "sub-domain" field blank and in the "Text" field put the following:
v=spf1 exists:%{i}.mta.spf.extendcp.co.uk exists:%{i}.web.spf.extendcp.co.uk -all
6) Once you have done this click on the "Update DNS" button underneath this table.
If you have any problems with this, you can contact us again and we will ad it for you.
Please note, that any DNS changes will need to propagate fully within all systems and this can take up to 24 hours however usually takes no more than around 4-6 hours. So you would need to allow for this amount of time before this SPF record would function correctly.
I hope this helps, if you have any more questions please feel free to ask.

Domain tranfer for (.com):-

Why usually IP Block for a account, Is there any chance for dedicated IP Block by any server. if all the web site and email is normal.
--If its a query for IP block in server firewall, it mostly get blocked due to failed login attempts or too many connection. If its a query for email bounce back its because the filter they applied on their network which automatically check the IP in known blacklists and block IP accordingly.

Your Previous shared IP shows Poor reputation in Email, is it causes for the Spam mail or how many email can handle a Dedicated IP.
--Yes, it happen some time as we do not control all the domains hosted on the server and due to less security of the resold accounts under resellers and if they get hacked spam emails sent from those account which affect shared server's IP reputation.

How can I monitor frequently IP and my cpanel customer.
--You can create an account with mxtoolbox and talosintelligence.com and if they provide alerts you can use them to get alerts for the IP reputations.

Individual Dedicated IP for cpanel customer can solve the poor status of the IP or web site health of a client. ?
--Yes, it will solve the issue, other workaround is we can set one dedicated IP for all your reseller accounts which will be affected by email sent from your account and your resold accounts only.

I am going to active your website now you need to follow the below steps at your end to optimize the website. 

============================== 
Wordpress is currently one of the most popular blogging/CMS applications. Here are some ideas for optimizing Wordpress and reducing the CPU consumption of this PHP script:- 

01. Make a backup of your account first, and then upgrade to the latest version of Wordpress. The latest versions have optimized code that could reduce the CPU consumption of your site. 

02. For permalink structure, do not start with the category, tag, author, or postname fields. Instead try /%year%/%postname%/ or /%post_id%/%postname%/. Also don't worry about 301 redirects as wordpress will automatically handle that after the permalink change. 

03. Install WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache, which can be done from your Wordpress Dashboard under Plugins. Follow the links below for information on how to setup these plugins. 

WP Super Cache (recommended) 
W3 Total Cache 
=================================== 
Many themes are more CPU intensive, So:- 

01. Make sure your page loads are generating no errors in your Error Log (in cPanel under Logs) 

02. Also, if you're using dynamic image resizing, you may want to disable this if possible. 

03. If all else fails, contact the theme provider for assistance, or change to a different theme. 

=================================== 
Disable CPU intensive plugins, or plugins that you no longer need:- 

01. All related posts plugins (WordPress Related Posts, YARPP) can cause significantly high load in most cases. 

02. WPRobot3 and other auto-posters can also cause high load issues, and should be disabled if they are causing issues 

03. StatPress and other wordpress statistics software should also be disabled, as these too can consume too much CPU in certain cases. Use Google Analytics instead for statistics. 

04. Any other plugins that are not vital to your Wordpress should be disabled. 
===================================
