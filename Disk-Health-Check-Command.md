### Install smartmontools ###

First, ensure the smartmontools package is installed. Run the appropriate command for your distribution:

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install smartmontools
```

#### RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux:

```sh
sudo yum install smartmontools
```

#### Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install smartmontools
```

#### Step 2: Check SMART Support

Check if your disk supports SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology):

```sh
sudo smartctl -i /dev/sdX
```

Replace /dev/sdX with the appropriate disk (e.g., /dev/sda).

Look for a line that says SMART support is: Enabled. If itâ€™s not enabled, you can activate it with:

```sh
sudo smartctl -s on /dev/sdX
sudo smartctl --scan | grep bus
```

#### Step 3: Perform a Quick Health Check

Run the following command to get an overview of the disk's health:

```sh
sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdX
```

This will return a simple health status (PASSED or FAILED).

#### Step 4: View Detailed Disk Information

To see detailed SMART attributes and statistics, use:

```sh
sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdX
sudo smartctl -a -d megaraid,9 /dev/bus/0
```

Look for attributes like Reallocated_Sector_Ct, Current_Pending_Sector, and Temperature_Celsius.

#### Step 5: Perform a Self-Test

To initiate a self-test, you can choose either a short or long test:

- Short Test (takes a few minutes):

```sh
sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdX
```

- Long Test (can take several hours depending on disk size):

```sh
sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdX
```

You can check the progress or results of the self-test with:

```sh
sudo smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdX
```

#### Step 6: Monitor SMART Logs

For detailed logs of disk events, use:

```sh
sudo smartctl -l error /dev/sdX
```

#### Notes:
- Replace /dev/sdX with the actual device identifier of your disk (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1).
- Running SMART commands on disks in a RAID array may require using specific utilities or bypassing the RAID controller.
